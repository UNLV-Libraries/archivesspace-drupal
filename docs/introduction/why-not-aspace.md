## Why not develop ArchivesSpace plugins instead?
- Drupal 8 is very stable and has an enormous developer and site builder community.
- Many institutions already have an investment in Drupal. 
- The Drupal community offers hundreds of high-quality modules to further extend AS2D8. 
- Drupal ships with [Views](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/views) a powerful SQL query builder that can access virtually any information in the Drupal database and display it in any format.
- Drupal theming is based on Twig, a widely-adopted and easy-to-use client-side templating language that makes theming a snap.
