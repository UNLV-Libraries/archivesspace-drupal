## AS2D8: ArchivesSpace-to-Drupal 8 integration
[AS2D8](https://www.as2d8.com/) is a series of Drupal modules for harvesting data from ArchviesSpace. AS2D8 extends the Drupal core Migrate API with plugins, provides sensible defaults for displaying ArchivesSpace resources in Drupal and all of the usual Drupal content and website management tools. AS2D8 closely tracks the [Islandora CLAW project](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW). When the next-generation of Islandora is stable, AS2D8 will offer an integration point for Islandora.
