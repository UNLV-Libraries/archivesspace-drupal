## AS2D8
#### ArchivesSpace-to-Drupal 8 integration

![AS2D8 Logo]()

## About this project
The [AS2D8](https://www.as2d8.com/) suite of modules supports pulling ArchivesSpace data to Drupal. It extends the Drupal core Migrate API with plugins. Changes can be made in real time or asynchronously in batches during cron run. Once ArchivesSpace records are consumed by Drupal, they can be further enriched with NISO-defined metadata, displayed in a customizable discovery theme layer, and further syndicated for consumption by other resources. 

A few possible use cases include:
- Using Drupal Views to build glossary displays, 
- Optionally deploying with Search API with Apache Solr to provide a configurable and granular control over search results 
- Building custom reports, logs, and user analytics
- Developing customized "Omeka-like" online exhibitions of archival material
- Researcher annotations, user-administered "favorites", save-for-later carts
- Managing research requests
- Joining archival records to geo-locations
