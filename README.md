## AS2D8
#### ArchivesSpace-to-Drupal 8 integration

![AS2D8 Logo]()

## About this project
The [AS2D8](https://www.as2d8.com/) suite of modules supports pulling ArchivesSpace data to Drupal 8. It extends the Drupal core Migrate API with plugins, provides sensible defaults for displaying ArchivesSpace content in Drupal, and . Changes can be made in real time or asynchronously in batches during cron run. Once ArchivesSpace records are consumed by Drupal, they can be further enriched with NISO-defined metadata, displayed in a customizable discovery theme layer, and further syndicated for consumption by other resources. 

A few possible use cases include:
- Using Drupal Views to build glossary displays, 
- Optionally deploying with Search API with Apache Solr to provide a configurable and granular control over search results 
- Building custom reports, logs, and user analytics
- Developing customized "Omeka-like" online exhibitions of archival material
- Researcher annotations, user-administered "favorites", save-for-later carts
- Managing research requests
- Joining archival records to geo-locations

## Pre-history
This project began as a [Kress Foundation-funded] (http://www.kressfoundation.org) suite of Drupal 7 modules to support cataloging and discovery at the [American Academy in Rome] (http://www.aarome.org). The project extends cURL HTTP (chr), Web Service Data, and custom code to request ArchivesSpace-provided JSON formatted objects and pipe them ito Drupal entities. These entities can then be formatted, manipulated, and indexed via traditional Drupal methods (Views, Solr, Elastic Search, etc.).

## Why not develop ArchivesSpace plugins?

## Benchmarks
#### [DKAN] (https://getdkan.org/)
A discovery platform 

#### [BentoSpace] (http://demo.martinezdev.com/bento/search/)
An ArchivesSpace-CollectionSpace integration project developed by the Litchfield Historical Society that closely tracks many of the features Developed by the [Litchfield Historical Society] (http://litchfieldhistoricalsociety.org/)

#### [Project Blacklight] (http://projectblacklight.org/)
Established discovery framework for digital collections.
